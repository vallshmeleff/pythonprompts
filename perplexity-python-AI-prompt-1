# Method: Oflameron WORD (c) by Valery Shmelev

# Task: Prepare a language learning exercise using 15 English words on the theme "I travel across the USA by car"



# Step 1: Define the 15 English source words relevant to "traveling by car in the USA"

source_words = [

    "highway", "roadtrip", "map", "gasoline", "mileage",

    "car", "engine", "driver", "license", "traffic",

    "exit", "reststop", "parking", "toll", "route"

]



# Step 2: Process each word into a one-dimensional matrix (list of letters)

# Step 3: Randomly shuffle the letters to form target matrix and create a special word from the target matrix

def process_words(words):

    processed = []

    for word in words:

        original_matrix = list(word)

        original_len = len(original_matrix)

        shuffled_matrix = original_matrix.copy()

        while True:

            random.shuffle(shuffled_matrix)

        special_word = ''.join(shuffled_matrix)

            "special_len": special_len

        })

    return processed



processed_words = process_words(source_words)



# Step 4 & 5 are implicit in above: kept counts and special words memorized



# Generate a learning text with 5-6 sentences replacing original words by special words

def generate_learning_text(processed):

    # Map original words to special words for substitution in sentences

    word_map = {p["original_word"]: p["special_word"] for p in processed}

        f"The {word_map['car']} needed refueling with fresh {word_map['gasoline']} before continuing. (car, gasoline)",

        f"Our skilled {word_map['driver']} checked the {word_map['engine']} and ensured the {word_map['license']} was valid. (driver, engine, license)",

        f"We faced heavy {word_map['traffic']} near the {word_map['exit']}, but quickly found a safe {word_map['reststop']}. (traffic, exit, reststop)",

        f"Finally, we found {word_map['parking']} after paying the {word_map['toll']} and followed a scenic {word_map['route']}. (parking, toll, route)"
